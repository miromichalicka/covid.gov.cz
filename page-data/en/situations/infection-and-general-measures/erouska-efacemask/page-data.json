If you are <strong>tested positive</strong>, you are given a <strong>unique code</strong> together with the results of your test.</p>\n<p>If you <strong>enter this code</strong> into <strong>eRouška</strong>, the app can alert those <strong>potentially infected</strong> about <strong>their risky encounter</strong>. Having the <strong>knowledge </strong>that they <strong>met </strong>someone who is <strong>infected</strong>, they can be more <strong>cautious </strong>and <strong>protect </strong>those in high-risk groups.</p>\n<h2>I got an SMS, telling me I'm positive</h2>\n<p>If you received a positive PCR test result, read the detailed instructions <a href=\"https://erouska.cz/en/sms\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. If the potentially infected are <strong>separated </strong>from others in time, this could <strong>prevent </strong>many more from <strong>contracting the illness</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please, enter the code into eRouška. This information is entered anonymously. Even one code can prevent dozens of people from getting infected.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"If I get an alert that I met with someone positive, do I automatically have to go into quarantine?","value":"No."},{"question":"Does eRouška keep track of my movements?","value":"No."},{"question":"Does anyone other than me find out that I got an alert about meeting someone positive?","value":"No."}],"links":[{"uri":"https://erouska.cz/en/caste-dotazy","title":"eRouška FAQ"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"Purpose of the measures"},{"title":"Where will the test results be sent?"},{"title":"Self-reporting"},{"title":"Quarantine"}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/erouska-efacemask"},"changed":"6. 11. 2020 13:46","valid_from":null,"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/erouska-efacemask"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
