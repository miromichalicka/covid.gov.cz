It is very accurate and efficient. This test is able to detect a Covid-19 infection even before the person becomes infectious and will allow early isolation. Thus, this method is able to prevent the transmission of the virus to other hosts.</p>\n<p>The disadvantages are the financial cost compared to the antigen tests, the longer evaluation time, and the need for highly professional staff for sample handling.</p>\n<p>Currently, the RT-PCR testing method is the only official method. Only the results of RT-PCR tests are meaningful.</p>\n<h2>Rapid Antigen test</h2>\n<p>Detects viral proteins. The rapid antigen test reveals patients at the peak of the infection when the body has the highest concentration of these proteins.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage is that they are not as sensitive (accurate) as the standard RT-PCR tests used to accurately identify those infected. When using them, a significant percentage of those infected pass the test as a false negative. In a few days, these people will spread the virus among others, thinking they are healthy.</p>\n<p>Their advantage is the price, the result within 30 minutes and lower demands on the expertise of the staff.</p>\n<p>If you are being tested with the Rapid Antigen test, you are NOT guaranteed to be uninfected at the time of taking the test.</p>\n<h2>Antibody test</h2>\n<p>This test measures antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the bodies of people who have already had Covid-19 or are successfully recovering from the disease. Antibodies are not present at the onset of the disease.<br />\nÂ </p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"links":[{"uri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02661-2","title":"More information"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"Quarantine"},{"title":"Isolation"},{"title":"How to get tested?"},{"title":"How to transport yourself to the testing?"}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/difference-between-rt-pcr-test-rapid-antigen-test-and"},"changed":"6. 11. 2020 12:46","valid_from":null,"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/difference-between-rt-pcr-test-rapid-antigen-test-and"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
