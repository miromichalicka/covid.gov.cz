The difference is that <strong>people in isolation are already infected</strong>. <strong>Quarantine, </strong>on the other hand, is used <strong>to separate people who are suspected of being infected </strong>but their diagnosis <strong>has not been confirmed or disproved yet</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>When to quarantine? </strong>You need to quarantine if you have been in <strong>high-risk exposure </strong>with a person who has been tested positive for coronavirus. Quarantine is mandatory. You can quarantine in most cases at home, or e.g. at your weekend cottage.</p>\n<p>Quarantine is ordered by a member of the staff of the local Public Health Office, or a special track and trace call centre.</p>\n<p>However, at the moment there are many cases of the infection, therefore it is likely that the track and trace team will not be able to reach you before you are actually infected. If there is anyone close to you who has been tested positive with coronavirus and you have been in high-risk exposure with this person, please be considerate to the others and quarantine voluntarily. Please contact your GP, inform them about the high-risk exposure. The GP practice will be able to provide a referral to the coronavirus testing centre.</p>\n<p><strong>How long do I need to quarantine? </strong>You need to quarantine for 10 days after the last contact with the infected person.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens next? </strong></p>\n<p>If throughout the whole quarantine no symptoms of COVID-19 appear and your <strong>RT-PCR test is negative</strong>, you are healthy, on the 11th day after the last contact with the infected person, your quarantine is over.</p>\n<p><strong>If your RT-PCR COVID-19 test is positive</strong>, you have been diagnosed with coronavirus and you need to self-isolate.</p>\n<p><strong>“The Game Rules”</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Stay at home (meaning: do not go to work, to school, or to any public places)</li>\n<li>Watch out for any symptoms of COVID-19 - especially higher temperature, cough or breathing difficulties.</li>\n<li>If any of these symptoms appear, please contact your GP. Your GP will advise what to do next.</li>\n<li>If a cough, fever, or breathing difficulties appear, please wear a face-covering which will protect people around you from getting infected.</li>\n<li>If possible, speak to your employer about any possibilities to work from home.</li>\n<li>Sanitize your home, especially often used surfaces and toilets.</li>\n<li>If you need to go e.g. to the pharmacy or shopping, ask your friends, neighbors, or social workers for any help. </li>\n<li>Stay in touch with your family and friends via phone, email, or social media. Look after your mental and physical health.<br />\n\t </li>\n</ul>"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"While in quarantine, can I stay somewhere that is not my permanent address?","value":" Yes.
