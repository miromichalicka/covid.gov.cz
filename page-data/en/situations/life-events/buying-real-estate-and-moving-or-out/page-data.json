If it is not necessary, postpone the purchase or sale of real estate until a more favorable epidemiological situation.</p>\n<p>Due to the restrictions on free movement, personal inspections of houses or flats<strong> can only take place in cases of absolute necessity</strong> (this is, for example, a situation where your rental agreement ends and you must secure new housing, housing is your basic need). <strong>Only one person or couple and one person from a real estate agency may take part in such a tour</strong>.
