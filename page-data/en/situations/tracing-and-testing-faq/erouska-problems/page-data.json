It may be an eRouška app error. Unfortunately, this cannot be completely prevented, as with any other location-based application. Your error might not be a single event, we recomend having a look at the social networks of eRouška. Possibly the team already knows about the error and are working on it. If that doesn't help, contact the eRouška team at info@erouska.cz.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"links":[],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Tracing and testing - FAQ","path":{"alias":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"eRouška / eFaceMask"},{"title":"How does tracing work?"},{"title":"SMS with a fake positive result"},{"title":"Testing"}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq/erouska-problems"},"changed":"5. 11. 2020 19:07","valid_from":null,"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/tracing-and-testing-faq/erouska-problems"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
