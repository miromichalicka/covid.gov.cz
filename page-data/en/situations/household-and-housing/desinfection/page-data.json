Slowly mix in 42 ml of hydrogen peroxide and stir it well. Then add 15 ml of glycerol- it is better to use a syringe for this, as it has a very thick consistency, and without the syringe, it is hard to measure the dosage. Then add boiled water so the level reaches 1l, close the container and shake it well. At this point, you can pour it into smaller containers that you can carry it with you. The final product should sit for three days, but if it is necessary, you can use it straight away as it works immediately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"How long can the virus remain on household items?","value":"The new coronavirus causing the disease COVID-19 often transmits through droplets or aerosols during the interpersonal contact. This transmission is more frequent than through contaminated surfaces such as door handles, mobile phones, toys, etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 \"survives\" on various surfaces different amount of time. It depends on the material of the object, relative humidity, degree of exposure to sunlight and temperature. It is less likely, but still possible, to become infected by the new coronavirus by touching the surface on which the virus is present. You can transmit it from your hand to your face easily, for example by rubbing your eye or touching your mouth or nose.\r\n\r\n• Metal surfaces - door handles, cutlery, jewellery - for up to 5 days\r\n• Wood - furniture, parquets -  for up to 4 days\r\n• Plastics - plastic packaging, seats in public transport, buttons in the elevator -  for 2 to 3 days\r\n• Stainless steel - pots, pans, sinks, fridge - for 2 to 3 days \r\n• Carton - packaging -  1 day\r\n• Copper - 10CZK coin - 4 hours \r\n• Aluminum - sheet metal packaging, aluminium foil  - for 2 to 8 hours\r\n• Glass - glass cups, glass containers, mirrors, windows - for up to 5 days \r\n• Food -  ready-made food from food delivery - free from COVID-19\r\n• Water - tap, bottled - COVID-19 is not present in the tap or bottled water\r\n• Fabrics - cotton, linen -  it is not known how long the virus \"survives\" on clothing, but probably no longer than on hard surfaces"}],"links":[{"uri":"https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/navod-na-vyrobu-domaci-dezinfekce/","title":"Detailed process for the production of home-made disinfection (in Czech)"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Household and housing","path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"Infected member of the household"},{"title":"Quarantine"}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/household-and-housing/desinfection"},"changed":"6. 11. 2020 14:39","valid_from":null,"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/household-and-housing/desinfection"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
