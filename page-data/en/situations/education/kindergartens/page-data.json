This will prevent the infection of other children and their families. If a teacher notices signs of infection, they put the child in isolation and contact the parents. The parents pick up the child and contact their doctor. If the doctor confirms that these are coronavirus symptoms, they issue a test request and advise on further steps.</p>\n<p>If more children in a class are infected, the Regional Public Health Authority (Krajská hygienická stanice or KHS in Czech) can recommend that the entire class be quarantined.
