Family visits have an exception to the ban on the free movement.</p>\n<p>So nothing banns you from visits within your family circle. <strong>However, it is wise to keep in mind the risk of infection.</strong></p>\n<p>A typical risky situation is <strong>visiting your parents when you are a university studen</strong>t studying in another city. Of course, no one restricts you from returning to your family house for the weekend - but if you live in <strong>shared accommodation, there is a relatively high risk of infection</strong>. During the visit back home, you can unknowingly pass the infection on to your parents. Therefore, please consider <strong>whether it is worth taking this risk</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have older parents, grandparents or other relatives from the high-risk group</strong> (long-term sick, people with weakened immunity), think carefully about whether it is worth exposing them to a potential risk of infection. If you meet a relative from the high-risk group, <strong>always wear a face mask or respirator and keep a two-meters distance.</strong></p>\n<p>If possible, avoid travelling <strong>by public transport or buses and trains.</strong></p>\n<p>Make sure to call or write your relatives regularly. It is important to stay in touch, especially in these difficult times.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"Can I meet with my family?
