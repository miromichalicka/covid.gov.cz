However, the law has been passed in response to the effects of the epidemic on legal persons.</p>\n<p>In practice, there may be situations where a member meeting of the association needs to decide on a certain issue, but it is not possible to meet. For these cases, the law defines the rules for how to take a decision for the duration of the exceptional measures, even if this is not enshrined in the articles of association. Specifically, it is the possibility of using technical means (eg. teleconferencing) or decision-making by correspondence voting (i.e. by mail or email).</p>\n<p>The possibility applies in general to legal entities, i.e. it is not only about associations, but also, for example, SVJ.</p>\n<p>The law also regulates the situation where a member of the body of a legal entity ends his term of office and it is not possible to agree on the extension or renewal of his office.Â In case of disagreement of a member with the extension of the term of office, it will be possible to solve this problem by so-called co-option. That is, the current members of this body will be able to choose a new member of the body, even if the charter does not allow it.</p>\n<p>However, it is necessary to emphasize that the measures for legal entities are valid only until <strong>31 December 2020</strong>, otherwise it is necessary to enshrine them into the founding legal proceedings!</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"links":[{"uri":"https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2020-191","title":"Legal regulation"}],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Club activities","path":{"alias":"/situations/club-activities"}},"related_situations":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/club-activities/membership-meetings"},"changed":"6. 11. 2020 09:26","valid_from":"23. 4. 2020","valid_to":"31. 12. 2020"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/club-activities/membership-meetings"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
