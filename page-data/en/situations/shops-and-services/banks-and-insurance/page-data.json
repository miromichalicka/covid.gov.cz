You can also sort out many things online. It is good to use e.g. internet banking.</p>\n<p><strong>Only sort out undelayable matters in person.</strong> Before visiting the bank or insurance company in person, it is good to call ahead and verify, whether the matter cant be sorted out via telephone or over the internet or schedule a time for your visit.</p>\n<p><strong>While in the bank or insurance company, wear a mask and social distance.</strong> Before entering, disinfect your hands. If you know that you will have to sign a document, it is good to bring your own pen, so you don't have to unnecessarily touch surfaces after other people.</p>\n<p>If it's possible, opt for contactless payment (transfer, card...) rather than cash. A large number of people touch money and not doing so when possible can decrease the risk of infection.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[],"links":[],"relationships":{"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Shops and services","path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services"}},"related_situations":[{"title":"Hygienic measures in the workplace"},{"title":"Indoor"},{"title":"Services"},{"title":"Myt√≠ rukou"}]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"},"changed":"5. 11. 2020 16:58","valid_from":"3. 11. 2020","valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/shops-and-services/banks-and-insurance"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1446925061","1481696057"]}
